The top layer is the mRNA and the bottom RNAseq
Will use two groups ER+ and ER- say.
If necessary we can filter further variables (genes) by their variability or some other criterion to make it more manageable

pathway.csv: Only 88 gene sets. The first row shows pathway id and the second row is the name of pathways.
samplegroup.csv: Includes subjects in both two datasets only. Consider the column ER positive or negative.
mRNA and RNAseq: Only genes in the 88 pathways are included here, so there are less than 4000 genes included.
RNAseq is count dataset (take log2 scale in analysis).
