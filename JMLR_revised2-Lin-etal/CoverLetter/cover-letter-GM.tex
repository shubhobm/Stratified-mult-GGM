\opening{Dear Editors,}

I would like to submit the manuscript titled  “Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Multi-layered Gaussian Graphical Models” to JMLR.

I confirm that no previous publication by the authors of this manuscript significantly overlaps with the current submission.

I also confirm that all the co-authors are aware of the current submission and consent to its review by JMLR.

I also confirm that none of the action editors have recently collaborated with the co-authors.

I believe that the following action editors are very suitable for reviewing  the manuscript:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Xiaotong Shen, University of Minnesota, USA.
	\item Hui Zou, University of Minnesota, USA.
	\item Sara van de Geer, ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
	\item Jie Peng, University of California, Davis, USA. 
\end{itemize}
\closing{Sincerely,}
